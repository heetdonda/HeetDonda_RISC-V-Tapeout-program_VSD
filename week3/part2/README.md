# ⚙️ Static Timing Analysis (STA) — Core Concepts and Path Types

Static Timing Analysis (STA) evaluates whether a digital circuit can meet its required timing constraints
at a given clock frequency. It verifies both **setup** and **hold** requirements across all timing paths
without the need for dynamic simulation.  
This document outlines timing path classifications, core STA metrics, and advanced considerations such as
OCV, CRPR, and signal integrity effects.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🧩 1. Timing Path Categories

### 🔁 Register-to-Register (reg2reg)
The most common and critical STA path type.
Begins at the **launch flip-flop** (clock pin) and ends at the **capture flip-flop** (data pin).
Ensures data passes through combinational logic and meets both setup and hold checks.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

### ⚙️ Input-to-Register (in2reg)
Describes timing from an **input port** to a **register’s data pin**.
Ensures external signals reach internal storage elements within one clock cycle.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

### 📤 Register-to-Output (reg2out)
Covers the path from a **flip-flop output** to a **primary output port**.
Used to determine when valid output data is available to external systems.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

### 🔄 Input-to-Output (in2out)
Represents a **combinational feedthrough** — data moves directly from input to output
without being stored in a register. Primarily checked for propagation delay.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

### 💡 Clock Gating Verification
Clock gating improves power efficiency by disabling inactive regions.
STA confirms that enable signals activate gates properly and prevent spurious clock pulses.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

### 🧭 Recovery and Removal
Applied to asynchronous control pins (reset/set) of flip-flops.

| Check Type | Requirement | Equivalent To |
|-------------|--------------|----------------|
| **Recovery** | Async signal must deactivate before next clock edge | Setup Time |
| **Removal** | Async signal must remain active after the edge | Hold Time |

---------------------------------------------------------------------

### ⚡ Data-to-Data Verification
Ensures proper timing relationships between two data signals, avoiding race conditions and protocol violations.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

### ⏳ Latch Timing (Time Borrowing)
Latches are **level-sensitive** devices that can “borrow” time from the next phase.
When transparent, data can propagate longer; STA adjusts analysis to reflect this flexibility.

---------------------------------------

## 📈 2. Key STA Metrics

### 🕓 Arrival Time (AT)
The actual time taken for a signal to propagate from its source to the destination.

### ⏰ Required Time (RT)
The latest time by which a signal must arrive to satisfy timing constraints.

- **Setup Analysis:**  
  RT = Capture Clock Edge + Capture Delay – Setup Time  
- **Hold Analysis:**  
  RT = Capture Clock Edge + Capture Delay + Hold Time  

---------------------------------------------------------------------

### 📊 Slack
Represents timing margin between the required and actual arrival times.

| Slack Type | Formula | Meaning |
|-------------|----------|----------|
| **Setup Slack** | RT − AT | Checks if data is fast enough |
| **Hold Slack** | AT − RT | Checks if data is not too early |

✅ **Positive Slack:** Meets timing  
❌ **Negative Slack:** Timing violation

---------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🧮 3. STA Calculation Methods

| Method | Approach | Strength | Limitation |
|---------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Graph-Based Analysis (GBA)** | Evaluates nodes and edges | Efficient | Slightly pessimistic |
| **Path-Based Analysis (PBA)** | Traces complete paths | Highly precise | Slower and memory-intensive |

GBA is used to identify critical paths; PBA is used for detailed sign-off.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🔩 4. Library and Cell Parameters

### ⏱️ Clock-to-Q Delay
Time between an active clock edge and the output transition of a flip-flop.

### 📚 Library Setup/Hold Values
Defined in the `.lib` file; determine the safe window where input data must be stable.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🕧 5. Clock-Related Factors

### 📉 Clock Jitter
Represents fluctuations in clock edge timing. Reduces effective timing margin and must be considered during STA.

### 🔀 On-Chip Variation (OCV)
Models variations in process, voltage, and temperature across different parts of the chip.

- **Setup Analysis:** Launch path slowed, capture path sped up  
- **Hold Analysis:** Launch path sped up, capture path slowed  

### 🧠 Clock Reconvergence Pessimism Removal (CRPR)
Removes duplicated pessimism introduced when common clock segments are derated twice under OCV analysis.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

## ⚡ 6. Signal Slew and Transition

Slew defines how quickly a signal changes from logic 0 to 1 or vice versa.
Affects gate delay, noise, and overall timing.

| Signal | Analysis | Objective |
|---------|-----------|------------|
| **Data** | Max (Setup), Min (Integrity) | Maintain valid logic transitions |
| **Clock** | Sharp transitions preferred | Reduce uncertainty and jitter |

---------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🔌 7. Loading Effects

### 🌿 Fanout
Indicates how many gates a single output drives.
Higher fanout increases load and slows down transitions.

### ⚖️ Capacitance
Represents total load (gate + interconnect).  
Analyzed for both maximum (setup) and minimum (hold) timing cases.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🕰️ 8. Clock Timing Parameters

| Clock Parameter | Description | Effect |
|------------------|-------------|---------|
| **Skew** | Difference in clock arrival between registers | Alters setup/hold windows |
| **Positive Skew** | Capture clock arrives later | Benefits setup, harms hold |
| **Negative Skew** | Capture clock arrives earlier | Benefits hold, harms setup |
| **Pulse Width** | Duration of high or low clock phase | Ensures valid operation |

---------------------------------------------------------------------

# 🧠 Digital Design Fundamentals — Latches, MOSFETs & Jitter

## 📘 1. Latch Operation

Latches are level-triggered elements whose transparency depends on the clock level.

### 🔹 Positive Latch
- Transparent when **CLK = HIGH**
- Data flows directly to output
- When **CLK = LOW**, latch holds the last output

### 🔹 Negative Latch
- Transparent when **CLK = LOW**
- Holds data when **CLK = HIGH**

Transmission gates (NMOS + PMOS) act as switches controlled by the clock and its complement.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

## ⚡ 2. MOSFET & Inverter Concepts

A MOSFET uses a gate voltage to form a conductive channel.

- Thin oxide → better control, faster switching  
- Thick or uneven oxide → slower response, degraded performance  

This process is fundamental in ensuring transistor reliability and timing consistency.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🕸️ 3. Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)

A DAG represents circuit connections for STA.

- **Nodes:** Logic pins  
- **Edges:** Gate or wire delays  
- No loops (acyclic), matching real combinational behavior  
- Used to find path delays and the critical timing path limiting clock speed

---------------------------------------------------------------------

## ⏱️ 4. Jitter and Eye Diagram

### 🔹 Jitter
Small deviations in timing edges from their ideal locations.

### 👁️ Eye Diagram
Visualization of signal integrity by overlapping multiple waveforms.

Interpretation:
- Wide eye → Stable timing  
- Narrow eye → High jitter, risk of errors  
- Thick edges → Increased timing noise
